a)  **What is Quarto?**  
Quarto is a new way to stylize various publications using a format comparable to R markdown but with more functionality, customization, an output style ability. 

b)  **How do you make columns using Revealjs in Quarto Presentations?**  
The code from the [Quarto Site](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#multiple-columns)  
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Left column
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Right column
:::

::::  
I can use the quarto command markers (::::), tell it what I'm doing {}, list my formatting preferences, and close the chunk.

c)  **How would you change the appearance of slides using Revealjs in Quarto Presentations?**  
Quarto uses a customized css file called "Sass" that let the user manipulate the theme. If you want to make appearance changes to individual slides you can follow the same conventions you would follow for R Markdown. If you have the time or inclination you can create your own custom themes.

d)  **What has been the biggest constraint working on your own research project in the past week?**  
Time and the QC component. We fixed the reference file situation in our meeting last week that will let me align my treatment sequences to a reference with suite of file types we were looking for. For now, I am skipping the QC and moving into the alignment and GE.
