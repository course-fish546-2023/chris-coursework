## Week 02 Question Set

a)  **What do you feel was the most impressive thing you did in class last week was?**  
Not throwing my computer when I realized I created an entire file structure in the wrong place, TWICE.  I was able to remove all of the wrong files and move the files I wanted quickly without creating another set of duplicates... that was big.

b)  **What is your weekly goal for making progress on your project? What is the next step?**  
This week I want to load the data, review the data and verify it is usable using the tools provided in the preparatory readings. After that I would like to see if I can reproduce a result from any of the data to ensure I understand the workflow.

c)  **There were two readings this week not from the textbook, meant for two different audiences. Which reading did you get the most out of and why? Do you have any questions regarding the Journal of Shellfish Research paper?**  
The content in the multifactorial analysis was clearly designed for advanced practitioners and was a bit overwhelming to read through even though I have seen it before. It is full of resources and a very dense read if you were looking for something a bit more basic. In the paper, I appreicate the step-through process and the caveats that go with eah step. I don't have any questions, yet.

d)  **What is your favorite thing about markdown and why?**  
Markdown is a nice clean way to present your code and the output of the code. It is an easily customizable tool that can look as polished as you'd like.  

e) **What is the differnce between `curl` and `wget`? When would you used one over the other?**  
Both are information transfer tools that can be used to access data from the internet, but 'curl' downloads specific and complex data from websites  and 'wget' pulls individual files that don't require anything but a download.
