a)  **What is your current grade in the class? How many issues are open in our research repository?**  
My current grade is 62% and I have 2 open issues in my research repo.

b)  **Re-reading this week's reading, what are 2 things that resonate with you now that made little practical sense in week 2. What is one aspect that you still wonder about or is unclear?** The two things that are a bit more practical are the placement of the visualization steps and the preparatory work to get you to your data. I'm not sure I was clearly understanding that most of the steps are there to support data manipulation into a usable format for the work - and I love that there existed an annotaion program called Dammit!, and not just because they use a Calvin & Hobbes cartoon. The part that is still a bit unclear is data trimming. What is the real purpose behind it, is it a standardized proess, is it truly necessary?


c)  **What is epigenetics and how could it relate to your own research project?**  
Epigenetics is the study of how an organism's gene expression is altered but not the genome itself. This is a (potentially) temporary alteration that can help or hinder the organism's fitness in its environment. My current project is assessing altered gene expression due to contaminant exposure and making physiological inferences about the impact of those alterations. Epigenetics can make this work more robust by providing a layer of analysis that can quantify organism impact, survival and potentially heritable responses in the face of persistent contamination stress.

d)  **Describe what a GFF file is?**  
GFF (general feature format) is a genome feature file that houses information about a gene's features (introns, exons, genes, etc) in a tab-delimited text file used for gene annotation.

e)  **What are two ways describing CG motifs could have value?**  
Describing CG motifs can add value in either gene heritability or in gene response to environmental stimulus.
