1. **What is your goal with respect to your research project to get accomplished this week?**  
I didn't plan anything since I was out of the area.

2. **What is the overall status of your research repo? Is it will organized with a clear Readme file? Are file names and directory clear? Would your classmates be able to understand what the code in your files is designed to do?**  
I had all three tables I need to get the annotation done, my list of differentially expressed genes, my cds for an annotated reference, and a blasted protein table from Uniprot. I would like to move forward with reviewing them and picking out a few stand out genes to explore.

3. **Go to one of your classmates rpubs link (see issues). What are three things you think are neat? What are two things that are really not that clear to you?**  
Sarah Yerrance's work is very nicely organized and the workflow/ process is clear. I really like the QC process outlined, I am unfamiliar with it so this was a nice walkthrough. I am also a scker for that scrolling table of contents - very classy. I also appreciate the inclusion of steps where the process went wrong (blast). It is real! What was unclear to me was some of the reasoning behind QC/ trimming choices and explanation of the taxon steps.
