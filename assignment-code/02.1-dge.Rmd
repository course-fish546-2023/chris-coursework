## Differential Gene Expression

Using RNASeq data to compare gene expression is a standard workflow to help scientists clarify which genes are differently expressed than their 'normal' state when exposed to your perturbations. This workflow uses the following tools:  
*Kallisto  
*DESeq2  

New terminology to you:  
*Annotation  
*Gene Enrichment Analysis  
*GO Terms  

#### Note: File structure is paramount! Check and double check you know where you are putting your files - it will save you in the long run!
